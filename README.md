This repo holds all the pre-requisite to my interview questions

To begin to work with the interview test, please **fork** this repo and find the test with the name `TestButtonNameChange`. In this test there are instructions how to run this test and what I want you to do. Time allotted for this test is one hour. Not finishing it within the allotted time is not a problem. It is more important for me to see, how you approach the issue/ problem.  

1. Fork the repo
2. Find test `TestButtonNameChange`
3. Check instructions
4. After you finished: send link to your repository
